*Python utility functions for manipulating SQLite databases*

This library helps create SQLite databases from an existing collection of data.

It is not intended to be a full ORM: the focus is utility helpers to make creating the initial database and populating it with data as productive as possible.

It is designed as a useful complement to `Datasette <https://github.com/simonw/datasette>`_.
